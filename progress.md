# StageGuard Progress

## Current status

StageGuard is a personal open-source Gemini/Google Cloud incident commander for live media workflows with Grafana as the read-only runtime evidence plane. The implemented vertical slice includes deterministic telemetry, Prometheus/Loki/Grafana, official Grafana MCP access, bounded investigation and diagnosis, optional Gemini briefing, exact-revision approval, remediation adapters, telemetry-verified recovery, authenticated lifecycle state, checkpoint/audit integrity, operator UI, Cloud Run deployment hardening, watchdog observability, authenticated private metrics bridging, evidence-unavailable abstention, no-replay execution reconciliation, recovery-only Grafana rechecks, stdio-only Grafana MCP launchers, strict operator-API authentication/framing/protocol preflight, and a loopback reference remediation provider with idempotent writes plus read-only operation reconciliation.

Detailed older run history remains in Git history; this file keeps current invariants, validation baseline, latest run, blockers, and next step.

## Core invariants

- Grafana/MCP is read-only evidence access; infrastructure-write credentials remain isolated.
- Supported MCP deployment is stdio-only; compose exposes only the required read-only datasource/Prometheus/Loki evidence surface.
- MCP launcher configuration, peer metadata, diagnostics, and smoke configuration are bounded, terminal-safe, and credential-redacted before operator display.
- Direct official `grafana/mcp-grafana` Docker launches, including recognized Docker Hub aliases, must explicitly use stdio.
- Gemini is advisory and cannot mutate diagnosis, approval, remediation, or recovery state.
- Required evidence unavailability prevents briefing, approval, and execution from becoming actionable.
- Approval is exact-revision-bound and single-use; provider acceptance never counts as recovery.
- Fresh Grafana telemetry is required to verify recovery; `recovery_unverified` cannot replay remediation.
- Ambiguous remediation execution remains behind the execution-uncertainty barrier until durable reconciliation and fresh evidence resolve it.
- Durable checkpoint/audit failures fail closed; provider operation reconciliation is required where supported.
- Operator API and reference remediation provider reject ambiguous credential/body framing before mutation.
- Metric/Loki activation is policy-owned and versioned; HTTP callers cannot supply arbitrary Grafana queries or datasource identities.
- Operator timeline disclosure is allowlist-based. Reconciliation exposes only canonical bounded `result` and `reason`; provider bodies, operation IDs, targets, credentials, arbitrary metadata, and raw actor identities remain private.
- Timeline event identifiers are non-empty, terminal-safe strings bounded to 160 characters before policy lookup or reconciliation parsing.
- Static timeline values are bounded JSON scalars and terminal-safe; nested values, oversized strings, non-finite floats, and unbounded integers fail closed.
- Static timeline field policy itself is bounded to 64 unique, non-empty, terminal-safe string keys of at most 128 characters; malformed, duplicate, oversized, string-as-iterable, and non-terminating allowlists fail closed.
- Timeline display strings reject C0/C1 controls, DEL, Unicode line separators, and Unicode bidi controls including ALM/LRM/RLM, embedding/override, and isolate controls.
- Timeline policy iterators and Mapping access are treated as untrusted extension/persistence behavior; ordinary read failures fail closed without partial disclosure.
- Static timeline projection reads each allowlisted Mapping value exactly once, avoiding membership/read TOCTOU behavior from custom persistence adapters.

## Retained validation baseline

- Local onboarding doctor: 8 passed, 1 expected Windows-specific permission test skipped.
- Focused core/API/UI suite from the last executable repository run: 81/81 passed.
- Historical full suite: 352 tests, 9 failures, 15 errors, 19 skipped; there is no full-suite green claim.
- Historical live Docker rehearsal: PASS twice consecutively, predating latest hardening/recovery work.
- Historical official Grafana MCP read-only smoke: PASS using `grafana/mcp-grafana:1.3.0`; pinned `1.4.1` still requires a live smoke.
- Current connector-authored tests have not been repository-executed in this runner and are not treated as passing tests.

## Latest run — 2026-09-16 — Unicode bidi mark timeline hardening

### Inspected at start

Read `progress.md` completely first, then inspected `runtime/timeline_projection.py` and `runtime/tests/test_timeline_projection.py`. Existing display validation rejected bidi embedding/override and isolate controls, but still allowed the Unicode Bidi_Control marks ARABIC LETTER MARK (U+061C), LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK (U+200E), and RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK (U+200F). Those invisible marks can alter operator-visible ordering without introducing a conventional control character.

### Changes / actions

- Extended `_safe_display_string()` to reject U+061C, U+200E, and U+200F in addition to the existing control, line-separator, embedding/override, and isolate exclusions.
- Added regressions covering all three marks in static timeline values, event identifiers, reconciliation event identifiers, and static field names.
- Preserved printable multilingual Unicode support; no ASCII-only restriction was introduced.
- No CI workflow, cloud resource, credential, remediation target, or unrelated repository was touched.

### Checks / results

- Implementation committed as `38cdc329130162e11444c47f4305fed872126b42`.
- Regression tests committed as `48e2b6fcb71f10f898ed0d5657c4ca13e0822c48`.
- This connector runner does not expose an executable checkout, so the new regressions were not executed and no green-test claim is made.
- No GitHub Actions workflow was triggered as a substitute for local validation.

### Decisions

1. Treat all currently relevant Unicode Bidi_Control marks as unsafe at the operator-display boundary, including invisible ALM/LRM/RLM marks.
2. Keep internationalized printable text supported rather than reducing the operator timeline to ASCII.
3. Reuse the central display validator so event identifiers, field names, and string values receive the same spoofing protection.

### Blockers / unknowns

- Latest timeline projection/public-audit/execution-safety and MCP smoke/launcher/negotiation/compose tests still require execution in a real checkout.
- Historical full-suite failures/errors still need classification from an executable checkout.
- A live read-only smoke against pinned `grafana/mcp-grafana:1.4.1` remains required.
- Disposable private Cloud Run acceptance still requires suitable credentials/environment and Docker.

## Single best next step

Run the consolidated MCP smoke/launcher tests plus focused timeline/public-audit/execution-safety suites in an executable checkout. If green, run the pinned Grafana MCP 1.4.1 read-only live smoke, then classify the historical full-suite failures.
